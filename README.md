# React Typescript Boilerplate

> Note: This is a boilerplate that only I expect to use, so my goal is to fit a very narrow config. That being said, I'm always open to ideas on how I can improve this.


## Installation

```bash
git clone depth=1 git@github.com:EmmaRamirez/react-typescript-boilerplate.git
npm i
rm -R .git
rename the repo, git init, etc
```

## Features

TBD.
